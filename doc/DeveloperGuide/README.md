# Developer guide
the purpose of this document is to explain how to develop with the runtime. The target audience are the developers.

This section focus on the development part, to create a new collection of connector/worker.
The developer can choose two different pattern:
* connector
* worker

The connector pattern embed the Connector SDK
![Architecture](../Architecture.png?raw=true)

In the next part of the documentation, we use the term of **Runner**. A Runner is a Connector or a Worker.

## Tutorial

Check the [Tutorial](../Tutorial/README.md) chapter to see how to create a connector / worker.

## Connector or Worker?

What is the difference between a `Worker` and a `Connector`?

Actually, a `Connector` is used behind the scene for the `Worker` implementation.
For the concept point of view, a `Connector` is reusable and generic, where a `Worker` is more specific to your company. 
This is why all component you can find on the community hub are connector.

The second technical difference is on the structure. A Connector take as Input a class, where all parameters are a member of the class.
A `Worker` access a list of variables. 


A Connector has then three class: 
* the function, where the core of the code is located
* an Input class
* an Output class

Keep in mind at any time you can move from a Worker structure to a Connector structure. The Cherry runtime execute both components
without distinction. The runtime call it a ``Runner``

To take advantage of the different tool, two abstract class are present in the library:

* The `AbstractConnector` implement the interface `OutboundConnectorFunction`.

* The `AbstractWorker` is the second abstract class.



## Principle
Let's create a new runner in your project. In order to keep the project consistent, some view rules has to be followed.
The model is the collection message (``org.camunda.cherry.message``), and the worker ``SendMessageWorker``.

- The first level of the Cherry project is the collection name. Your connector must be attached in a collection, and may be under a sub collection.
  A collection is a package. For example, the runner ``SendMessage`` is under the collection ``message``.

- The worker must be suffixed by the name ``Worker``, a connector by the name ``Connector``.
  Example: Package is ``org.camunda.cherry.message``, class is ``SendMessageWorker``.
  If this class need another class, it can be saved under the same package, or under a sub package.

- type name Convention: type should start by ``v-<collectionName>-`` to identify a Cherry connector and don't mixup with different connectors.
  It must follow the snake case convention (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)
  Example: ``c-message-send``.

- README in each collection. This file explains all runners present in the collection. For each runner, this information has to be fulfilled:
    - the runner name
    - a description
    - the type
    - Inputs
    - Outputs
    - Errors the runner can throw.

# Reference guide


## Input declaration

![Inputs](TemplateModeler.png?raw=true)
Give a list of Input that your connector / worker expect.
Each parameter has:
- a name (message)
- a label (Message to log). This label is visible in the Element Template for example
- a type. Multiple getter are available to access variables
- a scope: OPTIONAL, MANDATORY
- a description

````
       Arrays.asList(
            RunnerParameter.getInstance("message", "Message to log", String.class, RunnerParameter.Level.OPTIONAL, "Message to log, to ensure the worker was called"),
            RunnerParameter.getInstance("delay", "Delay in ms", Long.class, RunnerParameter.Level.OPTIONAL, "Delay to sleep, in milliseconds")
        ),
````

This information build the documentation and the Element-Template

![InputDocumentation](InputDocumentation.png?raw=true)

### Decorators


A parameter has multiple decorators. These are used to generate a rich Element-Template.

**setVisibleInTemplate()**
A Mandatory parameter is visible every time.
An Optional parameter has a checkbox. The designer has to select the checkbox to be able to give the value.
With this decoration, the optional parameter is visible at any time.


**getAccessAllVariables()**
A connector/worker accesses a list of predefined variables.
You may need to have dynamic access: a variable is a prefix (designer says "_green"), and the connector/worker will access the `temparature_green` variable.
When a parameter adds this decorator, then all variables in the process instance will be fetched to the connector/worker.

**addCondition()**
To condition the visibility of a parameter by another parameter.
Let's say that you have a parameter COUNTRY and a parameter STATE. You want to show the parameter STATE only when COUNTRY equals USA or BRAZIL.
Then, on the parameter STATE, add

````
.addCondition("COUNTRY", Arrays.asList("USA", "BRAZIL"));
````

**addChoice()**
A parameter can be a list of choice, and the designer will choose one in the dropdown. Add all choice via this decorator

````
.addChoice("USA", "United State Of America")
.addChoice("Brazil", "Brazil")
.addChoice("FR", "France")
````


### List of BPMN Errors

![Bpmn Errors documentation](BpmnErrorsDocumentation.png?raw=true)

Give the list of BPMN Errors that the connector/worker can throw. This list will be available in the documentation.
The Element-Template will contain the FEEL expression to transform a `ConnectorException` to a BPMN Error.
Without this list, all `ConnectorException` will be transformed into a Fail.

### Output declaration
Output follow the same rule as the input

### Declaration in a Worker
The worker has only one class, and get directly the information from the context.

Declare in the constructor the different input.
(see `src/main/java/io/camunda/cherry/embeddedrunner/ping/worker/PingWorker.java`)

`````java
@Component
public class PingWorker extends AbstractWorker implements IntFrameworkRunner {

  public PingWorker() {
    super("c-ping", 
          Arrays.asList(
              RunnerParameter.getInstance(INPUT_MESSAGE, 
                  "Message", 
                  String.class, 
                  RunnerParameter.Level.OPTIONAL,
                  "Message to log"),
              RunnerParameter.getInstance(INPUT_DELAY, 
                  "Delay", 
                  Long.class, 
                  RunnerParameter.Level.OPTIONAL,
                  "Delay to sleep")),
          Collections.singletonList(
              RunnerParameter.getInstance(OUTPUT_TIMESTAMP, 
                  "Time stamp", 
                  String.class,
                  RunnerParameter.Level.REQUIRED,
                  "Produce a timestamp")), 
          Collections.emptyList());
    }
`````
In the execution, you can access parameters via the different `getInput...Value()` methods

`````
String message = getInputStringValue(INPUT_MESSAGE, null, activatedJob);
Long delay = getInputLongValue(INPUT_DELAY, null, activatedJob);
`````



### Declaration in a Connector
The declaration in the connector is different. The Input is an object. Second, a notation `@OutboundConnector` must be declared.

In the annotation, you must give the different inputVariables.
These variables are defined in the InputObject, and the name of the variable in the notation and the name in the object **must be identical**

The recommendation is to declare a constant for each Input to ensure consistency. Attention, the value in the constant must be the exact name as the variable name.


`````
public class PingConnectorInput extends AbstractConnectorInput {

// see
// https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/integration-framework/connectors/custom-built-connectors/connector-sdk/#validation

@NotEmpty
protected final static String INPUT_MESSAGE="message";
private String message;

protected final static String INPUT_DELAY="delay";
private int delay;

protected final static String INPUT_THROWERRORPLEASE="throwErrorPlease";
private boolean throwErrorPlease;
`````
Then the value can be used in the declaration

`````java
@Component
@OutboundConnector(name = PingConnector.TYPE_PINGCONNECTOR,
    inputVariables = { PingConnectorInput.INPUT_MESSAGE,
                       PingConnectorInput.INPUT_DELAY,
                       PingConnectorInput.INPUT_THROWERRORPLEASE },
    type = PingConnector.TYPE_PINGCONNECTOR)
public class PingConnector extends AbstractConnector implements OutboundConnectorFunction 
`````

In the constructor, reference the Input class and the Output class. The Cherry runtime will introspect these class to create the documentation and the Element-template

`````java

public PingConnector() {
  super(TYPE_PINGCONNECTOR, 
        PingConnectorInput.class, 
        PingConnectorOutput.class,
        Collections.singletonList(new BpmnError(ERROR_BAD_WEATHER, "Why this is a bad weather?")));

`````

Doing this ways, the Cherry framework will not find the documentation to build the documentation or the Element-template.

Do do that, the Input object need to extends the `AbstractConnectorInput` class

````
public class PingConnectorInput extends AbstractConnectorInput {
````

and override a `getInputParameters` method

````
@Override
public List<RunnerParameter> getInputParameters() {
  return Arrays.asList(
    RunnerParameter.getInstance("message", "Message", String.class, RunnerParameter.Level.OPTIONAL, "Message to log"),
    RunnerParameter.getInstance("delay", "Delay", Long.class, RunnerParameter.Level.OPTIONAL, "Delay to sleep"),
    RunnerParameter.getInstance("throwErrorPlease", "Throw ControllerPage Please", Boolean.class,
    RunnerParameter.Level.OPTIONAL, "If true, then the connector throw an error"));
}
````

Same with the Output object

````
public class PingConnectorOutput extends AbstractConnectorOutput {
````

and

````
@Override
public List<RunnerParameter> getOutputParameters() {
  return Arrays.asList(
    RunnerParameter.getInstance("timeStampMS", "Time stamp", Long.class, RunnerParameter.Level.REQUIRED,
"Produce a timestamp"),
    RunnerParameter.getInstance("ipAddress", "Ip Address", String.class, RunnerParameter.Level.REQUIRED,
"Returm the IpAddress"),
    RunnerParameter.getInstance("parameters", "Parameters", Map.class, RunnerParameter.Level.REQUIRED,
"Returm parameters"));
}
````

### Output as a list of variable or as an object?
The output of your connector may be
* a list of parameters. Then you can match one parameter by one in the Element-template, in multiple variables. Or if you don't want a result, just do not match it.
* an object saved in one process variable

**Save the result as an object**
![Output as an object](OutputConnectorObject.png?raw=true)

This is the default behavior.

Just reference the Output object.

````java

public class PingObjectConnectorOutput {

  private final Long internalTimeStampMS;
  private final String internalIpAddress;

  public PingObjectConnectorOutput(long currentTimestamp, String ipAddress) {
    super();
    this.internalTimeStampMS = currentTimestamp;
    this.internalIpAddress = ipAddress;
  }

  /* Return an objet, getter can be regular */
  public long getTimeStampMS() {
    return internalTimeStampMS;
  }

  /* Return an objet, getter can be regular */
  public String getIpAddress() {
    return internalIpAddress;
  }
}
````


**In multiple output parameters**

![Output as a list of variable](OutputConnectorFields.png?raw=true)

Then, you have to specify the list of outputs in the method `getOutputParameters()` and
**You must create a getter for each member, starting with a lower case**
For example, for the object

````java
private long internalTimeStampMS;
````

the method must be
````
public long gettimeStampMS() {
````
if the *time* does not start by a lower case, then Zeebe will not find the value and can't do the correct mapping.

`````java
public class PingConnectorOutput extends AbstractConnectorOutput {

  private long internalTimeStampMS;
  private String internalIpAddress;

  private Map<String, Object> parameters;

  public PingConnectorOutput() {
    super();
  }

  public PingConnectorOutput(long currentTimestamp, String ipAddress, Map<String, Object> parameters) {
    super();
    this.internalTimeStampMS = currentTimestamp;
    this.internalIpAddress = ipAddress;
    this.parameters = parameters;
  }

@Override
  public List<RunnerParameter> getOutputParameters() {
    return Arrays.asList(
      RunnerParameter.getInstance("timeStampMS", "Time stamp", Long.class, RunnerParameter.Level.REQUIRED,"Produce a timestamp"),
      RunnerParameter.getInstance("ipAddress", "Ip Address", String.class, RunnerParameter.Level.REQUIRED,"Returm the IpAddress"),
      RunnerParameter.getInstance("parameters", "Parameters", Map.class, RunnerParameter.Level.REQUIRED,"Returm parameters"));
  }

  /* The getter must start by a lower case */
  public long gettimeStampMS() {
    return internalTimeStampMS;
  }

  /* The getter must start by a lower case */
  public String getipAddress() {
    return internalIpAddress;
  }

  public Map<String, Object> getparameters() {
    return parameters;
  }
}
`````



## Optional method

You can override different method:
````
     @Override
     public String getName() {
        return "MyConnector";
    }

    @Override
    public String getLabel() {
        return "My First Connector";
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Verify that the connector is visible in the Modeler via the template, and is executed correctly.";
    }

  @Override
    public String getLogo() {
        return WORKERLOGO;
    }

    private static final String WORKERLOGO = "data:image/svg+xml,%3C?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' standalone='no'?%3E%3Csvg   xmlns:dc='http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/'

    @Override
    public String getLogo() {
        return WORKERLOGO;
    }
    
````
The logo must be a SVG image.

## Execution
Then here you are: the execute method!

To simplify the implementation, a set of getter() is provided to access any input.
````
public String getInputStringValue(String parameterName, String defaultValue, final ActivatedJob activatedJob) {
public Double getInputDoubleValue(String parameterName, Double defaultValue, final ActivatedJob activatedJob) {
````

````
@Override
public void execute(final JobClient jobClient, final ActivatedJob activatedJob, ContextExecution contextExecution) {
   String message = getInputStringValue("message", null, activatedJob);
   Long delay = getInputLongValue("delay", null, activatedJob);
   ...
   
   setOutputValue("timestamp", formattedDate, contextExecution);
}
````

You have different method to access the input, in the correct class.
To produce the result, use a setOutput method. This method verify that you respect the Output contract.


## File management
Camunda 8 does not propose any solution to manipulate files.

In a connector/worker, a file can be manipulated. For example, OfficeToPdf needs an MS Office or an Open Office document as input and will produce a PDF document as a result.

Cherry uses the [Zeebe Cherry File Storage](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zebee-cherry-filestorage) library.

The StorageDefinition concept specifies how to access files (same concept as a JDBC URL).
Then the Runner LoadFileFromDisk required a storage definition and produced a "fileLoaded" as output.
Note: the storage definition is the way to access where files are stored, not the file itself.


When you want to save a file for the first time, you need to specify the location. This is the *Storage definition*.
Cherry uses this storage definition to do the job. A process variable is then calculated to access the file.

You can access the method set and easily access the file.
````
setOutputFileVariableValue("MyFile", storageDefinition, fileVariable, contextExecution);
````

To access the file, use the method.

````
FileVariable fileVariable = getInputFileVariableValue("MyFile", activatedJob);
````
Cherry will do the job to load the file where it is.

Note: the Cherry runtime contains embedded connectors `loadFile` and `saveFile` to load and save files using the storage definition.



Existing storage definitions are (refer to the library to have the complete list of storage):
* **JSON**: files are stored as JSON, as a process variable. This is simple, but if your file is significant, not very efficient. The file is encoded in base 64, which implies a 20 to 40% overload, and the file is stored in the C8 engine, which may cause some overlap.

Example with LoadFileFromDisk:
````
storageDefinition: JSON
````
fileLoaded contains JSON information with the file
````
{"name": "...", "mimeType": "application/txt", value="..."}
````

* **FOLDER:<path>**. The file is stored in a folder with a unique name to avoid any collision.

Example with LoadFileFromDisk:
````
storageDefinition: FOLDER:/c8/fileprocess
````
fileLoaded contains
````
"contractMay_554343435533.docx"
````
Note: the folder is accessible by Runners. If you run multiple Cherry applications on different hosts, the folder must be visible to all applications.

* **TEMPFOLDER**, the temporary folder on the host, is used to store the file with a unique name to avoid any collision

Example with LoadFileFromDisk:
````
storageDefinition: TEMPFOLDER
````
fileLoaded contains
````
"contractMay_554343435533.docx"
````
This file is visible in the temporary folder on the host.

Note: the temporary folder is accessible only on one host, and each host has a different temporary folder. This implies your Runners run only on the same host, not in a cluster.

## Access the Element Template

Start the Cherry runtime. Your connector appears in the dashboard, and the Element Template file can be downloaded.

You can download the complete collection to save for the desktop Modeler.

Or you can access the definition of one connector/worker to create a connector template in the Web Modeler. One connector template must be created one by one.
